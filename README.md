# TuneTalk
This repository is in charge of front-end operation for the TuneTalk web application.\
Backend repository: https://github.com/JamesColesanti/tunetalk-node-server-app

### Running the frontend

In the root directory, run `npm start` (you'll need to run `npm install` the very first time). After several moments (or minutes, depending on the speed of your machine), a browser will open with the frontend running locally.

You should see this screen (the backend will also need to be running for full functionality):
