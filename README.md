# TuneTalk
This repository is in charge of front-end operation for the TuneTalk web application.
Backend repository: https://github.com/JamesColesanti/tunetalk-node-server-app

### Running the frontend

In the root directory, run `npm start` (again, you'll need to run `npm install` the very first time). After several moments (or minutes, depending on the speed of your machine), a browser will open with the frontend running locally.
